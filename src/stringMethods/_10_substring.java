        Method Task: They are used to extract a substring from a larger string
        - They are non-static, and we'll call them with objects
        -They are return type, and they return another string
        -There are 2 overloaded substring methods
            1. substring(int beginIndex)
                - This method takes begin index as an argument, and it extracts a substring from given index to the end
            2. substring(int beginIndex, int endIndex)
                - This method will take 2 args to define which index to start and which index to stop to extract
                a substring
       NOTE: beginIndex is inclusive but endIndex is exclusive
       NOTE: if your beginIndex is equal to endIndex, then it will return empty string
       NOTE: if your beginIndex is less than endIndex, then it will throw StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
